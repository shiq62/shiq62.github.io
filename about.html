            <p>“It felt like I had a mental block preventing me from focusing on the page,” says writer and book lover Sophie Vershbow, who captured the mood early in the pandemic when her tweet about “not being able to concentrate enough to read a book” was liked more than 2,000 times. She’s not alone; do a quick search and you’ll find an avalanche of articles on people who can’t concentrate, the prevalence of ‘brain fog’ and different ways to ‘hack your concentration’.</p>
            <p>It is important to take the strain off your working memory by tuning out any “extraneous cognitive load”. This means putting greater effort into organising your time and being disciplined about distractions. Aim to set aside realistic but dedicated times of the day for different tasks, whether work or domestic duties. For instance, when you’re working, don’t have the news on in the background. When you’re playing with your kids, don’t have your mobile by your side ready to check emails or Twitter. Allow your mind to focus on one thing at a time and you’ll be rewarded by feeling less mentally exhausted. </p>
